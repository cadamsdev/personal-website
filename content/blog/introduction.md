A brief introduction about myself. My name is Chad Adams, I am a 25 year old Software Developer from Minnesota, USA. I am a Full Stack developer. I enjoy writing UI's because I like making software visually appealing and useful. I used to create desktop apps and sell them for a living. I have recently moved towards web apps because I believe they are the future. Just about every device out there supports JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

I recently decided to start a Blog. The reason I wanted to start a blog was to share my experiences of what I have learned throughout my journey as a Software Developer. My blog is going to share what I have learned or discuss a topic of my interest.
