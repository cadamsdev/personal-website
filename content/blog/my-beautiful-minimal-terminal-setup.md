## Terminal Choice
[Hyper](https://hyper.is/) - The reason I use Hyper over other terminals is because I wanted a terminal that works on both Mac and Linux since I use both frequently. On a Mac and I previously used ITerm2. ITerm2 has a couple features I like more (e.g Command + Click to open a folder). Though Hyper has better themes in my opinion and I want a terminal that looks good.

## Shell
[Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) - So recently a co-worker of mine told me about this.  Before I used to hate command-line because I hate typing the commands out all the time. This is the perfect solution for me. I could use the zh shell that's default on Mac OS Catalina though I found the Fish Shell to have syntax highlighting and better intellisense.

## Shell Prompt
[StarShip](https://github.com/starship/starship) - I also recently came across this. I absolutely love this prompt because I don't have to install various plugins for Hyper.

## Theme
[Hyper Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/hyper-material-theme) - I'm a big fan of Google Material. I use this because it's simple and clean.

## Font
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) - I use this font because it looks clean, it's easy on the eyes and I enjoy the programming ligatures.

## Plugins
I try to keep the terminal as minimal as possible so I don't like to use that many plugins.
