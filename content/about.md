## About me

I am a 27 year old Software Developer from Bluffton, SC. I enjoy building web, mobile and desktop applications. I have been professionally developing software for over 5 years now. I mainly work on full stack web development but I can do just about anything. I've worked on mobile apps (Android and iOS) and video games in the past. A passion of mine has been creating user interfaces because I like making software visually appealing and giving the user a better experience.

I have an associates degree in Computer Programming from [St Cloud Technical and Community College](https://www.sctcc.edu/) located in St Cloud, MN.

I currently work at a software company called [Verys](https://verys.com/). Which is a software consulting company based in Santa Ana, California. At Verys I currently work on [Experian](https://experian.com).

In my spare time I enjoy building my own personal apps and keeping up to date with technology. I like reading blogs and articles relating to technology. I am also currently learning Dev Ops and in the process of obtaining a few Amazon AWS Certifications.
