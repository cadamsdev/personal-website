## About me

I am a 26 year old Software Developer from Bluffton, SC. I enjoy building web, mobile and desktop applications. I used to be a game developer but in the past few years have transitioned to full stack web development. A passion of mine has been creating user interfaces because I like making software visually appealing and giving the user a better experience.

I have an associates degree in Computer Programming from St Cloud Technical and Community College located in St Cloud, MN.

I currently work at a startup company called [Lightfeather.io](https://lightfeather.io/). We work on modernizing the United States government. 

In my spare time I am building a budgeting app called PaylessBudget which is a much cheaper alternative to [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (You Need A Budget) and [EveryDollar](https://www.everydollar.com/). I'm setting a goal this year to release PaylessBudget.
