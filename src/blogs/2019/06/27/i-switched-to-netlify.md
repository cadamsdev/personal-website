title: "I Switched To Netlify"

Previously, I was using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host my blog. I switched to Netlify after encountering a strange issue with GitHub Pages. Every time I deployed my blog to GitHub pages I would have to go to the repository settings and add my custom subdomain back. That issue was frustrating and oddly enough I was looking for an alternative. I came across [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and I instantly fell in love with it. I gave it a try and it was incredibly simple to setup, simpler than GitHub pages in my opinion.

The reasons why I love Netlify are...

 - It's free (for personal or open-source projects)
 - Supports custom domains
 - Supports HTTPS (Generates a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) Cert)
 - Has Continious deployment (every time you push changes to your repo your site will be deployed if the build passes)
 - Easier and faster to setup
 - Integrates with GitHub
 - Can do everything GitHub Pages can do
 
So far I have not encountered any issues with Netlify. I would highly recommend Netlify.
