            I was first introduced to programming at the age of 12 when I used
            to play a game called RuneScape. I was fascinated by how the game
            worked. I wanted to create my own version of the game so I worked on
            RuneScape private servers. The first programming language I used was
            Java because that was the language RuneScape was made in. Iâ€™m a big
            advocate for open-source software. I love Linux, my favorite linux
            distrobution is Ubuntu.

            Throughout the years I have worked with numerous programming
            languages including: C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, PHP,
            Golang, Lua, Dart and TypeScript. Out of the programming languages I
            have used my favorite so far is Kotlin because I enjoy the syntax
            and the language has little to no boilerplate.
