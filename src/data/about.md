I'm a Software Developer from Bismarck, ND. I develop all types of software, ranging from websites, to mobile apps, to desktop apps. Coding is my passion. I enjoy writing software that helps makes peoples lives easier.

I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin called Luck. I have an associate's degree in Computer Programming at St Cloud Technical and Community College in St Cloud, MN.

I'm a certified Microsoft developer. After college I worked at ColdSpring Granite Company as a Software developer in ColdSpring, MN. I was there for over a year, we in the Microsoft stack. (C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server). After ColdSpring I consulted with them for a few months then worked at my current job at NISC as a Software Associate in Mandan, ND.
