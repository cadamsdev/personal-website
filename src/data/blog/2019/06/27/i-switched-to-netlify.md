title: "I Switched To Netlify"

Previously, I was using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host my blog. I switched to Netlify after encountering a strange issue with GitHub Pages. Every time I deployed to GitHub pages I would have to go to the repository settings and add the custom subdomain back. That issue was frustrating and oddly enough I was looking for an alternative. I came across [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and I instantly fell in love with it. 

If you don't know what Netlify is, its a static website host provider. They make everything incredibly simple from the dashboard to 1-click https and fast setup. I gave it a try was surprised how nice it was.

The reasons why I like Netlify thus far...
 - It's free (for personal or open-source projects)
 - Supports custom domains
 - Supports HTTPS (Generates a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) Cert)
 - Has Continious deployment (every time you push changes to your repo your site will be deployed if the build passes)
 - Incredibly easy to use
 - Integrates well with GitHub
 - Can do everything GitHub Pages can do
 
If you're looking for a host provider for your open-source or personal project I would highly recommend checking out Netlify.
