I've always wanted to create a business email. I was researching ways I could setup a business email for free. I came across an article where you could use Gmail and [smtp2go](https://www.smtp2go.com/). Unfortunately Google no longer supports this because people were able to send emails with spoofed "from" email addresses. Next option I looked into [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/mail/?zmc=zoho-fa&ireft=ohome). I was able to setup a free business email through them however I'm not able to use gmail. I've been a long time gmail user so using something other than gmail feels odd. Currently "me@chadalen.com" is using Zoho so I don't have to pay for it. Eventually I'm going to switch to [Google's G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/). One reason I love Google's G Suite is that it's incredibly easy to setup. Also for $6 a month you can have multiple business emails and from multiple domains. I was able to setup "feedback@scape.tools" and "chad@stellasoft.io" within 15 minutes.
