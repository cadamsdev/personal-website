# Kotlin OSRS (aka BattleRune)
BattleRune is a reverse engineering project I started that aims to create a usable osrs server.

### Info
* Written in Kotlin from scratch
* Netty 4.1 for back end networking
* Designed to be least verbose as possible
* Used the latest technologies (at the time)
* TOML is used for storing game settings
* Gradle is used as the build tool and dependency manager
* JSON is used for serializing static data
* Clean code
* All XTEAs (all maps)

### Completed
* Logging in
* Sending and receiving packets
* GPI
* Sidebar interfaces
* Logging out
* Welcome screen
* Most packets have been identified
* Player updating masks
