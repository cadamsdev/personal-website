This was a website I made for Turmoil.io

**Tech Stack**

* React.js (Frontend)
* Next.js (React framework, used this to make the site isomorphic. Initial render is on the server for good SEO and page load then subsequent data fetches are rendered on the client)
* MySQL (Database)
* Stripe (Payment Processor)
* Node.js
* SendGrid (Email Delivery Service)

Web store page. Users would go here to buy in-game items. They can either buy the actual item or the amount of credits so they can purchase the item in-game themselves. If they purchase the item on the web store the item will be waiting for them at the donator shop in-game.

This is where users would go to download the game client. They can either pick the "Launcher Installer" which would download my other project the Turmoil Launcher (which is an electron app) or they can download the Jar Launcher which is the Java version.
