This was a website I made for Turmoil.io



**Tech Stack**

* React.js (Frontend)
* Next.js (React framework, used this to make the site isomorphic. Initial render is on the server for good SEO and page load then subsequent data fetches are rendered on the client)
* MySQL (Database)
* Stripe (Payment Processor)
* Node.js
* SendGrid (Email Delivery Service)
